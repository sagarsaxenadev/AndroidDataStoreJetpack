# AndroidDataStoreJetpack
I have used datastore library to store data in this project. you can download the project and learn about the implementation of datastore. It's very easy 

Add this in your gradle file
dependencies {
    // Preferences DataStore
    implementation "androidx.datastore:datastore-preferences:1.0.0-alpha01"
}

Check latest version : https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore

DataStore uses Kotlin, Coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously with consistency and transaction support
